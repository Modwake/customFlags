Custom mod that lets you load your own flag for your own ship.

## Initial Setup

The custom flag goes in `Managed/Mods/Assets/FlagReplacement/` (You may have to create this folder if you have not already run the mod, in which case it will have been made for you.)

You must name it `customFlag.png`

Your steamID is to be placed in `Managed/Mods/Assets/FlagReplacement/` named `steamID.txt`. **NOTE: YOU MUST USE YOUR STEAMID64**

Should look like this when you are done:

- `Mods/Assets/FlagReplacement/customFlag.png`
- `Mods/Assets/FlagReplacement/steamID.txt`

## Note

Currently only supports a single steamID.
